####### create new django project process flow
Certainly! To initialize a new Django app inside an empty directory on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django app using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\empty\directory
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment. Replace `venv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

	** for git bash use below instead to activate 
	. venv/Scripts/activate   ---> where . is the source directory
	
   - Note: The prompt should change to show the name of your virtual environment.

3. **Install Django:**
   - With the virtual environment activated, install Django using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install django
     ```

4. **Create a Django Project:**
   - Run the following command to create a new Django project. Replace `myproject` with the desired name for your project.
     ```bash
     django-admin startproject myproject
     ```
   - This will create a new directory (`myproject`) with the initial project structure.

5. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd myproject
     ```

6. **Create a Django App:**
   - Run the following command to create a Django app. Replace `myapp` with the desired name for your app.
     ```bash
     python manage.py startapp myapp
     ```
   - This will create a new directory (`myapp`) with the initial app structure.

7. **Configure Settings:**
   - Open the `settings.py` file inside your project (`myproject`) directory.
   - Add your app (`myapp`) to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

8. **Run Migrations:**
   - Run the following commands to apply migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

9. **Create a Superuser (Optional):**
   - Run the following command to create an admin superuser:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter a username, email, and password.

10. **Run the Development Server:**
    - Start the Django development server:
      ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
    - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to see the default Django welcome page.

That's it! You've successfully initialized a new Django app inside an empty directory on Windows. You can now start building your web application within this Django project and app structure.
